## 🌟 Project Overview
This project leverages **FireDucks** to forecast **traffic flow** using the **Traffic Flow Forecasting Dataset** from Kaggle.
By utilizing **data engineering, feature engineering, and AI modeling**, we aim to predict traffic patterns with high accuracy.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:
🔗 **[Traffic Flow Forecasting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/traffic-flow-forecasting-dataset)**

📂 The dataset includes:
- Traffic adjacency matrix (`tra_adj_mat.csv`)
- Traffic flow data (`tra_speed.csv`, `tra_volume.csv`, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
✅ **Python**
✅ **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
✅ **Scikit-learn (ML models)**
✅ **FireDucks (for efficient data processing & benchmarking)**
✅ **Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VS Code**
